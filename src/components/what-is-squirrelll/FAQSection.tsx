                What is Squirrelling? (The Concept)
              </AccordionTrigger>
              <AccordionContent className="px-6 pb-6 pt-2 text-white/80">
                Squirrelling is not a modern inventionâ€”it's rooted in one of the oldest economic practices: setting aside small amounts for future use. Just like how squirrels stash food bit by bit for winter, squirrelling in micro-finance means building stability, habits, and wealth through consistent micro-savings over time.
&nbsp;&nbsp;
Known as "Susu" in West Africa, people contribute a fixed amounts and receive big sums in rotating basis. In Mexico, they call it "tandas" where they contribute and save small amounts in a routine contribution. 
&nbsp;&nbsp;
In different communities, the name and the goal might be different, but the concept is always the same to gather bigger with small amounts.

                What is the Daily Pool exactly?

              <AccordionContent className="px-6 pb-6 pt-2 text-white/80">
                It's a daily micro-contribution act. You contribute a small fixed amount and one person (including you) from your region/country receives the total pool at 12 PM. Which can help you and others to help towards their financial goal or milestone. The pool happens daily.
